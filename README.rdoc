= PureMotion

A Ruby wrapper for transcoding and reading media formats supported by FFmpeg

== Usage

To load and read information from streams in a media file you can call Media
with a block

    Media 'test.mpg' do

        if video? then

            puts "Resolution : #{video.resolution.join('x')}"

        end

    end

Check the documentation on the *PureMotion::Media* class for methods that can be
called within the block
